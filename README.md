# etch-a-sketch

An Etch a Sketch game, using CSS Grid and mouseenter event

I had some problems with the gradient mode, I tried to do it using HSL colors, but when i tried to get the color it always returned in a rgb format, so I had to modify every single color in rgb.

Also, when I was testing I found out that the container was also changing the background color so I had to put an if statement to avoid this.
